# Dandelion
Dandelion is a full-stack application that allows users to make an account and helped imagine their life in a new way through it's organizational features. Dandelion allows users to craft their own moodboard and view other's posts on its feed and save their posts to their own board. Users can manage their to-do lists. All users also receive a motivational quote to help get their day started on a high note.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS HTML, Tailwind CSS , JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Multer, Passport, Moment

I used EJS to apply my HTML and Tailwind for the CSS to on the front-end. I used JS for some conditional features like allowing users to save posts belonging to other users and also by not showing a users posts on the feed. Node was used to craft the server and all information is stored on MongoDB. Passwords are hashed before storing. 

## Optimizations

Some optimizations to consider in the future include adding a subtask feature, and allowing for user to view other users profile and their specific mood boards.

## Lessons Learned:

This project really tested my abilities to manipulate features I had already tested. I took influence from some prior projects I crafted leading up to this one.
